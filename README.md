<h3>A digital clock that greets you, shows (time, date, day, timezone) and has a To-Do List with a soothing background.</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The Website greets you Morning, Afternoon or Evening based on the time.</li>
  <li>In the center of the screen is the clock with date, day, time and timezone.</li>
  <li>A to-do list to jot down your tasks. <b>The tasks are stored too so even if you close the browser, the tasks will be still there after you come back.</b></li>
</ol>
